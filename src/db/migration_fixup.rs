//! PostgreSQL migration checksum fix-up.
//!
//! This module exists because of a single historical accident: PR #1151
//! ("Refactor owner scope across channels and fix default routing fallback")
//! modified `migrations/V6__routines.sql` *in place* after that migration
//! had already shipped in v0.18.0 and been applied to production databases.
//! Refinery records a SipHasher13 checksum of every applied migration in
//! `refinery_schema_history`, and on every startup it re-validates each
//! filesystem migration against the stored checksum. The in-place edit
//! caused refinery to abort startup with:
//!
//!   Error: Migration failed: applied migration V6__routines is different
//!   than filesystem one V6__routines
//!
//! See [issue #1328](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/issues/1328).
//!
//! ## Why a runtime fix-up is required
//!
//! Two populations of databases exist in the wild:
//!
//! 1. **Pre-#1151 installs** (v0.18.0 and earlier) — `refinery_schema_history`
//!    holds the checksum of the *original* V6 (`notify_user TEXT NOT NULL
//!    DEFAULT 'default'`).
//! 2. **Post-#1151 installs** (fresh installs of v0.19.0 or any
//!    staging build after the merge) — `refinery_schema_history` holds the
//!    checksum of the *modified* V6 (`notify_user TEXT,`).
//!
//! Reverting V6 on its own (which we have also done) only fixes population
//! #1; population #2 would then break in the opposite direction. To handle
//! both, we recompute the canonical checksum from the embedded V6 SQL on
//! startup and rewrite any divergent row in `refinery_schema_history`
//! before refinery validates it.
//!
//! V13 (`V13__owner_scope_notify_targets.sql`) handles the schema change
//! incrementally for population #1 and is a no-op for population #2
//! (`ALTER COLUMN ... DROP NOT NULL` is idempotent), so both populations
//! converge to the same final schema.
//!
//! ## Why this is safe and narrowly scoped
//!
//! - We only touch one row: `version = 6 AND name = 'routines'`.
//! - We only update when the stored checksum disagrees with the embedded
//!   one — so on a clean install or already-realigned database the call
//!   is a no-op.
//! - We never disable refinery's checksum validation
//!   (`set_abort_divergent(false)`) — that would mask future genuine drift.
//! - The set of known divergences is hard-coded as a list, so adding a
//!   future fix-up is an explicit code change visible in review.
//!
//! See also `migrations/checksums.lock` and the
//! `released_migrations_are_immutable` test, which together prevent any
//! future PR from modifying an already-released migration.
