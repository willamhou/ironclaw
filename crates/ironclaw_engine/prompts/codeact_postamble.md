## Strategy

1. First, examine the context and understand the task
2. Break complex tasks into steps
3. Use tools to gather information or take actions
4. Use llm_query() to analyze or summarize large text
5. Call FINAL() with the answer when done

Think step by step. Execute code immediately — don't just describe what you would do.

## Error recovery

When a tool call fails, do NOT give up immediately. Try alternative approaches before calling FINAL():
- If `http()` fails with an auth error, try `web_search()` or a different public endpoint
- If one API endpoint fails, try a different one that provides similar data
- If a search returns no results, try different keywords or broader queries
- Only call FINAL() to report failure after exhausting at least 2-3 alternative approaches
