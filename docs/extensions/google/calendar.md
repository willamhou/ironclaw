The Google Calendar extension allows your agent to interact with your Google Calendar — creating events, checking your schedule, updating appointments, and more. It's ideal for automating scheduling tasks, setting reminders, or managing meetings directly from your agent.

## Setup

If you haven't set up Google OAuth yet, complete the [Google OAuth Setup](/extensions/google/oauth-setup) first.

<Steps>

<Step title="Enable the Google Calendar API">

In your Google Cloud project, navigate to **APIs & Services → Library**, search for [**Google Calendar API**](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/calendar-json.googleapis.com?q=search&referrer=search), and click **Enable**.

</Step>

<Step title="Install the Extension">

```bash
ironclaw registry install google-calendar
```

</Step>

<Step title="Authorize Access">

```bash
ironclaw tool auth google-calendar
```

IronClaw will provide a URL for you to authenticate - remember to follow the [auth setup](./oauth-setup) to enable your agent to capture the callback. If possible, it will open a browser window. Once approved, the token is stored securely and refreshed automatically.

<Tip>
If you already authenticated one Google service, you still need to authenticate each additional Google extension separately.
</Tip>

</Step>

## Working with Multiple Calendars

If your Google account has multiple calendars (personal, work, shared), you can tell your agent which one to use:

<Tip>
Say something like: _"Add this to my Work calendar, not my personal one."_ The agent will use `list_calendars` to find the right calendar by name before creating the event.
